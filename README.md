# VDCWorkbench
The VDCWorkbench Modelica Library is a holistic platform for developing, testing, and validating vehicle dynamics controllers and hybrid vehicle energy management algorithms.

The library was submitted for the "Call for Libraries" at the [Modelica Conference 2025](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2025/) and will be uploaded here right before the Conference at the beginning of September 2025.

## Reference results
